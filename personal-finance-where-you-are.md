# Where you are
## Introduction
When you start thinking about investments, ETF and... became rich, you need a starting point! 

The first point is to understand the "as-is situation". In the following sections, we will analyze how to understand you current situation. I know this may sound boring but I guarantee that this is the first fundamental step.

## üí∏ Spending Analysis
You need a place to put your expenses in order to analyze how much you are spending.
Spoiler: usually we spend a lot of money, more than we think!

You can setup a really complex spending checking strategy.
You can choose between a lot of different budgeting apps (there are a lot of really complete solutions).

My choice is simple: **Google Sheets**. 
I have a single document containing multiple sheets: 
- a configurable dashboard
- the spending sheet
- the gain sheet
- a more complex analytics dashboard
- net worth and investments

Of course you have to start with a single sheet.
You can have as much columns as you want. You can add a lot of columns like: 
- subcategory
- payiment method
- notes

 My advice is: follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. Start with only the necessary columns that you really need

| Date       | Name                 | Price | Category       |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ----- | -------------- |
| 22/07/2022 | Book "Atomic Habits" | 22.50 | Study          |
| 23/07/2022 | Sushi                | 12.70 | Food           |
| 24/07/2022 | Home Rent            | 350   | Housing        |
| 24/07/2022 | Car Rent             | 170   | Transportation | 

The next step is to **create the habit to add your expenses** in this file. Of course now you have a simple template but you must be patient and populate a new row every time you buy something. Probably, this is the most difficult part


At the end of the month you can check your spending (using categories you can also check the spending-per-category).

Categories are mainly personal but these are general ones working for everyone: 
- Housing
- Transportation
- Food
- Utilities
- Clothing
- Medical/Healthcare
- Insurance
- Personal
- Debt
- Education
- Savings
- Gifts/Donations
- Entertainment

## ü§ë Earning 
Now you know how much you spend. The next step is understand your earnings and how they change during the time. 

In my case I have created another sheet on Google Sheets in the same file. If you are using an app, probably there will be a section to add you earnings. 

Usually you will have your employee salary if you are an employee but you could also have multiple earning strategies or occasional earnings. 

Keep track of everything. 

You could use the info in the earning and spending sections to calculate for instance your savings and [savings rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savings-rate.asp).

Savings formula => total earn - total spending (simple, isn't it?)
Savings rate => (savings / total earn)\*100


## üêªDebt
Do you have debts? Like credit card debts, personal loans and so on? 
Right! 

The first thing to do is to write them down! If you are paying the car loan for example, you need to understand:
- what is the total loan
- how much I have already repaid
- how much I can repay each month (accordingly to my expenses)
Then you can figure out how much time you need to estinguish your debt.

The second thing to do is: try to estinguish it as soon as possible!

## üëõ Wealth Management

Now you should have a good understanding of your financial situation.
You should have: 
1. An expenses tracking system
2. An earnings tracking system
3. A good understand of your debt

Now, the last point for now is to understand your net worth and start manage it.

To understand your net worth you must create another table with months as columns (since the net worth changes every month) and each row is a worth storage.

A worth storage could be an investment, a bank account, a prepaid card and so on.
This is an example: 

| Storage        | January | February | March | ...   | ... |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| Bank Account 1 | 1200    | 1350     | 1400  | 1320  |     |
| Bank Account 2 | 700     | 600      | 800   | 950   |     |
| RoboAdvisor 1  | 35000   | 37250    | 37100 | 38000 |     |
| -              |         |          |       |       |     |
| Total          | 36900   | 39200    | 39300 | 40270 |     |

You can choose one day in the month to update this table (in my case I update the table the last day of the month).

By doing this, you can also calculate the total, average and differences between months.

See you in the next section ;)
